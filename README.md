# Code Club Project ReadMe

Welcome to the Code Club Project! This repository is dedicated to providing an interactive and engaging platform for learning and developing coding skills using Python. Follow the instructions below to set up the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites before getting started:

- A stable internet connection.
- Access to the command line interface (CLI) or terminal on your machine.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

### 1. Download Python LTS Version

Download and install the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/). Ensure that Python is added to your system's PATH during installation.

### 2. Update pip

Once Python is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and update pip (Python's package installer) to the latest version by running the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 3. Install Flask

Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. Install Flask by running the following command:

```bash
pip install flask
```

### 4. Install Color Thief

Color Thief is a module for grabbing the dominant color or a representative color palette from an image. Install it by running:

```bash
pip install colorthief
```

### 5. Install TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework. Install TensorFlow by running:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

### 6. Run the Server

Navigate to the root directory of your project and start the server by running the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This command will start the application using the `app.py` file located in the root directory of your project.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser. Ensure to replace `5000` with the actual port number your server is configured to run on, if different.
